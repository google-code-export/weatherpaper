= Platform =

== Windows ==

Windows XP and Vista are supported. Download and run the installer.

== Linux ==

At the moment, only GNOME and KDE 3.5 are supported. This is because KDE 4.x removed the system call that changed and refreshed the desktop background. I have not yet figured out what the new system call is. If you know how to change the desktop background from the command line in KDE 4.x, please let me know so I can add this functionality.

=== Dependencies ===

  * Python (2.5 or later)
  * PIL (may already be installed, if not download from http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil)

=== Instructions ===

Run the installer by opening a terminal window and typing

{{{
$>sudo sh install.sh
}}}

Start WeatherPaper by navigating to Applications->Accessories->WeatherPaper (Gnome)
