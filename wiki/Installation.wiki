#summary How to install WeatherPaper on your system

= Platform =

== Windows ==

Windows XP and Vista are supported. Download and run the installer.

== Linux ==

=== Dependencies ===

  * Python (should already be installed)
  * PIL (may be installed, if not download from http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil)

=== Instructions ===

At the moment, only GNOME and KDE 3.5 are supported. This is because KDE 4.0 removed the system call that changed and refreshed the desktop background. I have not yet figured out what the new system call is.

At the moment things are still a bit manual. I am looking into creating a .deb installer and/or a Make installer to automate process.

For now:
{{{
$>mkdir $HOME/.weatherpaper
$>cp settings.conf tango.zip $HOME/.weatherpaper
$>mkdir /opt/weatherpaper
$>cp weatherpaper.py pywapi.py /opt/weatherpaper
}}}
Then add "/opt/weatherpaper/weatherpaper.py" to your startup programs (System->Preferences->Startup Applications in Ubuntu 9.04).
