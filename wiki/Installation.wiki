= Platform =

== Windows ==

Windows XP and Vista are supported. Download and run the installer.

== Linux ==

At the moment, only GNOME and KDE 3.5 are supported. This is because KDE 4.x removed the system call that changed and refreshed the desktop background. I have not yet figured out what the new system call is.

=== Dependencies ===

  * Python (2.5 or later)
  * PIL (may already be installed, if not download from http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil)

=== Instructions ===

Run the installer by opening a terminal window and typing

{{{
$>sudo sh install.sh
}}}

Then add "/opt/WeatherPaper/weatherpaper.py" to your startup programs (System->Preferences->Startup Applications in Ubuntu 9.04).
