WeatherPaper supports custom wallpaper packs. Wallpaper packs are collections of wallpaper images and ...

== wallpapers.xml ==

This is the file that tells WeatherPaper which images are included in the pack and to what weather conditions they correspond. 

The first line is always the XML declaration. Following that is an optional information section. Title, author and url should each be on a single line only. It is prefered that the  identifiers, "@title", "@author", "@url" should contain only lowercase letters.

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!--
@title Tango Wallpaper Pack
@author Steven Nichols & Tango Desktop Project
@url http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project
//-->
}}}

The next section links wallpaper images with their respective weather conditions. All image declarations should be contained within the "<wallpapers>" tag.

Each image has the following basic structure:
{{{
<image codes="">
  <file>filename</file>
</image>
}}}



{{{
<wallpapers>
    <image codes="0,1,2,3,9,11,12,37,38,39,40,45,47">
        <file>storm.jpg</file>
    </image>
    <image codes="-1">
        <file>error.jpg</file>
    </image>
</wallpapers>
}}}

== overlay.xml ==

= Example =

Lets say I found a pack of high-resolution weather icons in the public domain. I would like to use these as the images for a new wallpaper pack.

The images are: "sunny.jpg", "cloudy.jpg", "storm.jpg", "unknown.jpg". I will create a new folder, "Tango", and copy all my images into it. Next I create two new documents, "wallpapers.xml" and "overlay.xml" in that same directory:

{{{
Tango
   |
   +--sunny.jpg
   |
   +--cloudy.jpg
   |
   +--storm.jpg
   |
   +--unknown.jpg
   |
   +--storm.jpg
   |
   +--wallpapers.xml
   |
   +--overlay.xml
}}}

Following the guidelines for wallpapers.xml, I come up with:
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!--
@title Tango Wallpaper Pack
@author Steven Nichols & Tango Desktop Project
@url http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project
//-->
<wallpapers>
    <image codes="0,1,2,3,9,11,12,37,38,39,40,45,47">
        <file>storm.jpg</file>
    </image>
    <image codes="31,32,36">
        <file>sunny.jpg</file>
    </image>
    <image codes="27,28,29,33,34,44">
        <file>cloudy.jpg</file>
    </image>
    <image codes="3200">
        <file>unknown.jpg</file>
    </image>
</wallpapers>
}}}

And likewise, for overlay.xml, I have:
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<overlay>
    <font file="AlteHaasGroteskBold.ttf" align="right" size="72" fill="#444">
        <line x="-30" y="140">%temp%%degree%%unit%</line>
    </font>
    <font file="AlteHaasGroteskBold.ttf" align="right" size="56" fill="#444">
        <line x="-30" y="70">%condition%</line>
    </font>
    
    <font file="AlteHaasGroteskBold.ttf" align="right" size="56" fill="#444">
        <errorline x="-30" y="70">%errormsg%</errorline>
    </font>
</overlay>
}}}

Since I have chosen to use a non-standard font, "AlteHaasGroteskBold.ttf", I will need to copy the font file into the folder as well.

The final step is to create a ZIP file from my Tango folder. I can now share "Tango.zip" with my friends!
